                    <h2>Correlations Found Using the Above Variables</h2>
                    <p>It isn't clear that many direct correlations can be seen. I notice that if you choose smoke % for the Y variable append and Household Median Income as the x-variable, it seems that there are a larger amount of smokers in the lower
                        median Income bracket. It isn't glaringly obvious, but it seems like a larger of cluster of states with lower median incomes have a greater % of smokers. Additionally, when you look at percent of smokers on the y-axis and percent
                        poverty we see a similar correlation.
                    </p>

                    <p>There seems to also be a correlation between Median Household Income and % of those Lacking Heatlthcare. The divide seems to be evident around the median income of about $55,000. It seems that those with a MHI of less than $55,000
                        lack Healthcare coverage. Again, it is not glaringly obvious, but quite a practial inference. With the exception of state Medical coverage programs such as Medicare, which skew this plot inherently, it is clear that the less income
                        members of a household have, they are likely less able to afford private healthcare.
                    </p>

                    <p>Another interesting, yet again not bizzare observation is that the majority of smokers seem to fall between the ages of 34 and 44. I would have thought we would have seen a larger amount of smokers in their 20's. So, I found this to
                        be interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>There weren't any relationships which really stood out. I would have like to look at other variables not given in the CSV. There are many medically interesting variables that we may have found interesting observations had we looked
                        at them. Like the percent of those suffering from a myriad of diseases such as cancer of many kinds and age, diabetes and obesity, and many many more. I come from the healthcare industry so I could think of a plethora of interesting
                        variable correlations. This assignment was difficult enough to not have to step outside that which was provided for us, but in the future, it is something I would like to look at.
